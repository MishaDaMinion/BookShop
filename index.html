      Ghosts is a book by one of my now favorite authors. Cat's younger sister Maya has cystic fibrosis and they had to move to a twon for her treatment. There, they beleive deeply in the mexican traditions and ghosts. This scares cat and makes her feel uncomfortable. Carlos, a boy who gives GHOST TOURS, suddenly meets the sisters, while Maya is enthusiastic to go, Cat is not, but she does it for her sister anyway. When they meet the friendly ghosts, they get carried away and take some of her breath (essence) to feel familiar to her, but because of her disease she suddenly wheezes terribly. Cat gets mad at carlos who feels bad and rushes her to the hospital. Now Maya has a permanent breathing tube. Cat starts a new school and everyone there is talking about the ghost festival, and she decides NOT to go, even when her new friends try persuading her, she only decides to open it up to her grandma, but her friends told her that is she opens the gate to one ghost, all the others are invited too. At this Cat freaks out and has a meltdown. Are the ghosts harmful? Are they bad? Is Cat gonna learn to trust ghosts? Is Carlos and her gonna be friends again? Will she go to the party? Find out more by reading this book! 4/5 stars!!
